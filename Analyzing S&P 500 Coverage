Problems:

AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP INC:
- Address in document for Eaton.
processed-data/valid-items.csv:008252108,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1076598/000094039413000025/affiliatedmanagers13g.txt,"600 HALE STREET, PRIDES CROSSING MA 01965",AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP INC,AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP INC COMMON STOCK,EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,SC 13G for EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,01/09/2013,41

- There was a valid CUSIP # for AFFILIATED MANAGERS common stock, but it was a duplicate of a filing for Eaton, which was processed first.
Since Eaton appears as the issuer in the filing title, the valid filing containing this CUSIP # was thrown out:

Filing for AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP INC common stock:

AIR PRODUCTS CHEMICALS INC DE
- Addressed not parsed from SC13 GA (found in document)
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2969/000093247115005274/airproductschemicalsinc.htm

AT T INC
- Too many matches to analyze because of ambiguous search term. Mostly unrelated companies.

E*TRADE
- No filings for common stock

FACEBOOK
- Search results show "SC 13G for Zuckerberg Mark" but the document shows an issuer name of Facebook, Inc.
- If the issuer name had been extracted from the document itself, this would have counted.

GOLDMAN SACHS
- Address failed to parse
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000151905815000133/gs.txt

NIKE INC

Two search results would have yielded CUSIP #'s for common stock:

- Search results show "SC 13G/A for KNIGHT PHILIP H" but the filing is for Nike (issuer).
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/903855/000032018712000018/f13gaknight.htm

- CUSIP incorrectly parsed (grabbed wrong text):
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000089742315000038/nikeinc13d063015.htm

WAL MART STORES INC

- Logs showed 40 results, but searches on Edgar show 93 results.
- All the results were for "STRATS SM TRUST FOR WAL MART STORES INC SECURITIES SERIES 2005," none of them for
 the parent corporation.
- No valid CUSIP was extracted.
- Unknown reason the subsequent pages of search results are missing.

ZIONS BANCORP
- Search results were unavailable during the crawl -- error undetermined. Could have been a site outage.
- Confirmed with a later search that there were several pages search results.
- Log messages:
