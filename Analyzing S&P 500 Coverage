Problems:

AFFILIATED MANAGERS:
- Address in document for EATON. Maybe some relationship between companies?
processed-data/valid-items.csv:008252108,http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1076598/000094039413000025/affiliatedmanagers13g.txt,"600 HALE STREET, PRIDES CROSSING MA 01965",AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP INC,AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP INC COMMON STOCK,EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,SC 13G for EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,01/09/2013,41

- No address found in any valid item for AFFILIATED MANAGERS
- Credit Agreement incorrectly parsed as "common stock"

AIR PRODUCTS CHEMICALS INC DE
- Addressed not parsed from SC13 GA (found in document)
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2969/000093247115005274/airproductschemicalsinc.htm

AT T INC
- Too many matches to analyze because of ambiguous search term. Mostly unrelated companies.

FACEBOOK
- Search results show "SC 13G for Zuckerberg Mark" but the document shows an issuer name of Facebook, Inc.
- If the issuer name had been extracted from the document itself, this would have counted.

GOLDMAN SACHS
- Address failed to parse
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000151905815000133/gs.txt

NIKE INC

Two search results would have yielded CUSIP #'s for common stock:

- Search results show "SC 13G/A for KNIGHT PHILIP H" but the filing is for Nike (issuer).
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/903855/000032018712000018/f13gaknight.htm

- CUSIP incorrectly parsed (grabbed wrong text):
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000089742315000038/nikeinc13d063015.htm

ZIONS BANCORP
- Search results were unavailable during the crawl -- error undetermined. Could have been a site outage.
- Confirmed with a later search that there were several pages search results.
- Log messages:
